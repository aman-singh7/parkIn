# ParkIn
A new Flutter project.

An app which will show the availability of parking space in or nearby a particular area and the user can prebook an early parking space. So that they can plan accordingly and have no issues in parking. They can also add multiple vehicles and choose as per their requirements. Payment will be done through this app only on the basis of an expected time that the user has entered. If any issues occur(like leaving the parking slot before time or after time) then we have designed(only) the merchant app from where this issue can be monitored. (we have not developed the merchant app, only designed it)
